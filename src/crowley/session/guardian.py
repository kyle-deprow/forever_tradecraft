"""Process-lifetime input lease and cancellation guardian.

The lease is acquired before a session can own a journal/socket and remains held
until the driver process closes.  Revocation only increments the generation and
releases physical input; it never unlocks the ownership file.  This prevents a
second daemon from taking over while the first daemon is still unwinding a
blocking capture or model call.
