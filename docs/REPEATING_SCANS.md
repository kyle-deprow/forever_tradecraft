# Repeating Crowley scans

The local session controller collects the curated 428-item watchlist every 900
seconds, anchored to actual scan starts. It preserves the original SavedVariables,
waits for the companion upload and exact Data.lua UID acknowledgment, reloads,
verifies that UID in the loaded HUD, and reopens the AH for the next cycle.
Normal scanning and acknowledgment use deterministic routines. Luna handles
bounded visual recovery when the game disconnects or presents an unexpected scene.

See [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for current deployment and live acceptance status.
This runbook describes the new passive-startup flow. The previous native/GTK
calibration instructions are preserved as
[historical diagnostics](../.archive/REPEATING_SCANS-legacy-calibration-20261022.md).
They are not prerequisites for normal scanning.

## Installation and profile

Use `deploy/crowley-session.example.toml` for the measured client profile. Fill in
its canonical plan hash/JSON and the existing SavedVariables, companion state and
Data.lua paths. Keep the journal under `~/.local/state/crowley/`; it holds durable
scan intents, acknowledgment evidence and the takeover record. Do not replace it
with an empty journal to clear a blocker.

The current client is Arthur, Classic Beta PvE 2, Alliance, build70450/interface
16001. The deterministic AH opener expects Auctioneer Jaxon in Stormwind City
within native interaction range. Positioning/navigation is separate from this
routine. The schema4 HUD publishes the target, range and CTRL-F12 binding facts
needed to verify that interaction.

Enable the game's **Enable Interact Key** option during setup. Forever's
[controls implementation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/forever/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_SettingsDefinitions_Frame/Controls.lua)
sets `SoftTargetInteract=3` for that checkbox; its
[native enum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/forever/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_APIDocumentationGenerated/SoftTargetConstantsDocumentation.lua)
defines1 as gamepad-only and2 as keyboard/mouse. The controller reads this mode
and refuses a disabled or unavailable keyboard interaction before pressing the
chord. Keep the prior setting in the setup receipt when changing it.

Build the pinned native input tool and install the editable controller:

```sh
uv run python tools/build_crowley_xdotool.py
uv tool install --editable /home/dev/repos/pegasus
mkdir -p ~/.config/crowley ~/.config/systemd/user
cp deploy/crowley-session.example.toml ~/.config/crowley/session.toml
# Fill and review the profile before starting the service.
cp deploy/crowley-session.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now crowley-session.service
```

The input-tool builder needs `cc`, `make`, `readelf`, `objdump`, `libx11-dev`,
`libxtst-dev`, `libxinerama-dev` and `libxkbcommon-dev`. It verifies the source and
published executable. The input owner and independent release watchdog share its
sealed executable image.

The model adapter pins Codex CLI0.162.1 and `gpt-6-luna`. Configure the provisioned
private CLI executable shown in the example, and verify it with `--version`.
A mutable global installation can update beyond that pin. The configured version
must match; the controller does not select another model or executable on failure.

Leave profile `xauthority` empty to inherit the current graphical session's
XAUTHORITY. The service uses the measured Wine process, window and display profile.
The native identity/region executable paths and their hashes must match the
installed artifacts specified by the profile.

## Startup and one-time takeover drill

Log into Arthur, leave the game idle near the auctioneer, and read status:

```sh
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml status
```

Each mutating command requires the current generation from status. For the first
start with no pending scan work:

```sh
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml start --mode repeat --generation <current-generation>
```

Start checks identity/focus, the measured input environment and native keymap,
held controls, the registered XI2 observer, and three advancing ordinary HUD
frames. These checks send no game input. Native memory measurement, addon resets,
GTK targets and typing the command vocabulary are optional diagnostics.

If status requests a takeover drill, run it while the operator is present:

```sh
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml takeover-drill --generation <current-generation>
```

The drill makes a small curved hover without clicking and then waits for genuine
input. Poll status from another terminal; `takeoverDrill.state = awaiting_input`
and `nextAction = provide_human_input` mark the accepting window. The operator
taps and releases Shift once. A passing drill proves pause/release, saves the environment-bound record
and leaves automation paused. Start repeat mode using the returned generation:

```sh
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml start --mode repeat --generation <after-drill-generation>
```

The record survives controller restarts and ordinary addon reloads. A changed
input hierarchy, native tool, keymap, display or takeover contract requires a new
drill. Process IDs and routine addon boot changes do not invalidate the stored
human evidence. Each new owner still collects fresh passive readiness.

## Pause, handback and failures

Physical input revokes automation. For an explicit pause:

```sh
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml pause --generation <current-generation>
```

When the game is handed back, use resume to preserve any pending scan or reload:

```sh
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml resume --generation <current-generation>
```

Resume checks current readiness and reconciles durable effects before sending
another action. Never use start to discard unresolved work. A service restart
recovers an active repeat session automatically; an existing operator pause or
stop remains held. If the restart readiness check fails, status records a BLOCKED
reason. Resolve that condition and use resume with the current generation.
A drill can be canceled from another terminal with
`takeover-drill-cancel --generation <current-generation>`.

Status exposes `startup`, `takeoverDrill`, `runtimeReadinessInvalidation`, `nextAction`,
the current scan intent and the exact blocker. Invalid telemetry, observer loss,
identity changes and input-environment changes have explicit causes; message
wording does not determine which proof is retained. Unknown input fails closed.
Readiness failures do not authorize another native benchmark or a fresh journal.

The AH opener targets Jaxon, checks native range, and verifies the session-only
CTRL-F12 action. It can set only an empty or already-identical INTERACTTARGET
binding, verifies the result, and never calls SaveBindings. It requires a newer
HUD confirming AH-open before scanning. Automated clicks elsewhere retain the
one-per-second limit and the curved, timed full press/release executor.

A server disconnect can leave a collection gap. Retain the last original scan and
its exact upload/loaded-ACK evidence, recover the current scene, and reconcile.
Do not repeat a submitted command merely because a later receipt failed.

## Verification

Run the focused startup, public restart, takeover, native keyboard/pointer,
protocol and addon tests for this change, then lint/format checks and
`git diff --check`. Review the frozen bytes before promotion. A schema3-to-schema4
cutover needs an owned staged reload because both the installed addon and editable
Python source resolve to this checkout.

Live acceptance consists of passive startup, the genuine one-time drill, a complete
autonomous save/upload/ACK/reopen cycle and a takeover/resume test. Record observed
900-second start intervals and actual gaps. Isolated Xvfb fixtures and model
snapshots do not establish live Mutter/Xwayland acceptance. Native memory
benchmarks and three validation-mode sweeps are not startup gates. Validation mode
remains available separately and closes out after three qualifying sweeps.

## Natural interaction commands

The motion executors use a separate interaction mode after passive startup and a
matching takeover drill pass. Enter it from the paused controller using its current generation;
read the returned status for the generation used by later requests:

```text
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml interaction-start --generation <current-generation>
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml motion-camera-calibrate --generation <interaction-generation> --delta-pixels 4
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml motion-movement-calibrate --generation <interaction-generation>
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml motion-key --generation <interaction-generation> --role move_forward --duration 0.08
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml motion-camera --generation <interaction-generation> --delta-pixels 4
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml motion-waypoint --generation <interaction-generation> --x <nearby-world-x> --y <nearby-world-y>
crowley-session --config ~/.config/crowley/session.toml interaction-stop --generation <interaction-generation>
```

Calibration measures actual camera response, then repeated forward/backward and
both strafe roles using fresh telemetry and visual route evidence. The technical
movement probe defaults to 0.03 seconds. Camera calibration accepts signed 4–8 pixel
drags. Waypoints require the measured mappings and remain within a cumulative
two-world-unit travel budget. Each physical action reserves fresh post-release
feedback; no progress, chat focus, stale evidence or cancellation stops it.
`interaction-stop` revokes without waiting behind an active motion request.
Scan scheduling remains idle in interaction mode.

The optional `pointer_profile`, `camera_profile` and `move_profile` configuration
fields select `"baseline"` or an absolute schema 2 profile path. The
`motion-profile build --demonstrations <numeric-json> --output <path>`,
`motion-profile show --profile <path>` and `motion-profile reset --profile <path>`
commands manage deliberately supplied summaries. See the
[executor architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#natural-interaction-executors) for the
timing model. Numeric imports do not establish live human calibration. Current
live acceptance and deployment status are recorded at the top of
[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).
