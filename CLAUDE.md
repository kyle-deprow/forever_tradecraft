# Crowley

Private auction house trading platform and addon for WoW Forever (launch 2026-11-04).
**Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` first.** It has the requirements, decisions, research, current
state and roadmap. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the technical reference.
Shared agent workflows live in `.agents/skills/`; see `AGENTS.md` for when to use them.

## Rules
- **No fallbacks.** Assume one way things work, encode only that, fail loudly, and fix the
  assumption if it's wrong. Record client assumptions in the HANDOFF §6 table.
- Never key items by name; use `itemKey` (`scanformat.py`). Never mix houses.
- Schema changes go in a new `src/crowley/server/migrations/NNN_*.sql`; never edit applied ones.
- Automated clicks are hard-capped at human speed: at most one per second, enforced in code as
  at least 1.0 s between consecutive automated clicks. No config, flag or caller may raise it.
- Every automated click is a full simulated human action through the session executor: curved,
  Fitts-timed pointer movement with human variability (submovements, endpoint scatter, seeded
  and recorded), then a real button press and release. Never warp the pointer or move linearly.
- Ask before committing, pushing, or destroying data.
